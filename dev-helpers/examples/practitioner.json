          However this cannot consistently be assured, and when the meaning is
          not guaranteed to be consistent, the version SHOULD be exchanged.

          the service base URL, or an absolute URL that resolves to the location
          where the resource is found. The reference may be version specific or
          not. If the reference is not to a FHIR RESTful server, then it should

          The type is the Canonical URL of Resource Definition that is the type
          this reference refers to. References are URLs that are relative to

          because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a
          known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a
          Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a
          FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be
          expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would
          need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.
