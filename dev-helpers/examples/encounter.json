          used for a case where an admission starts of as an emergency
          encounter, then transitions into an inpatient scenario. Doing this and
          not restarting a new encounter ensures that any lab/diagnostic results
          can more easily follow the patient and not require re-processing and
          not get lost or cancelled during a kind of discharge from emergency to
          inpatient.
