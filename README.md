Swagger UI
==========

Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically 
generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API. Because Swagger UI has no 
dependencies, you can host it in any server environment, or on your local machine.

How to Use It
-------------

```bash
wget https://github.com/downloads/wordnik/swagger-ui/swagger-ui-1.0.zip
unzip swagger-ui-1.0.zip
open swagger-ui-1.0/index.html
```

How to Improve It
-----------------

1. [Fork!](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui)
1. Hack.
1. Submit a pull request.

Note: The HTML and CSS are converted from Haml and Sass, which means there are currently some development 
dependencies. We are looking into revamping the source files and eliminating all development 
dependencies by using [less.js](http://lesscss.org/)
