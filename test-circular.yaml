### Description
This PR resolves issue #10616 where Swagger-UI becomes unresponsive when expanding certain operations that include circular model references.

### Root Cause
Circular `$ref` references in schemas cause infinite recursion in the React component tree while rendering model properties.

### Solution
Added a recursion guard in `model.jsx` that:
- Tracks visited schema references
- Prevents infinite rendering loops
- Displays a short warning for circular structures instead

### Reproduction
1. Create a simple OpenAPI file with a self-referencing schema:
   ```yaml
   components:
     schemas:
       User:
         type: object
         properties:
           manager:
             $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
